# MbtaSchedule

This is a lightweight app I built in the Phoenix framework.  It pulls the data about train time for the Boston commuter rail from their
JSON data-feeds and populates the with accurate times, destinations, and late status.

I also used React to create the real-time and date feeds on the page.

To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
